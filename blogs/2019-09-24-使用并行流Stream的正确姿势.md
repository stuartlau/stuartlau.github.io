> 并行流是一把利剑，玩不好会伤害到自己，本文对parallel stream的使用场景进行分析。

*注：本文大部分观点均来自`StackOverFlow`的这个[帖子](https://stackoverflow
.com/questions/20375176/should-i-always-use-a-parallel-stream-when-possible)和`Brian Goetz`大神的[Understanding Parallel Stream Performance in Java SE 8
](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/parallel-java-se-8/)，非常值得一读。*

### 并行流不是万金油
> it is a bad idea to just drop .parallel() all over the place simply because you can.

并不是说你将流转化为并行流就可以在多核环境下加快你的计算，因为计算的过程及逻辑是由你的代码来实现的，如果实现写的不好，可能会因为使用并行流而降低效率，甚至还不如串行的速度快。

并行流唯一确定的是，它比串行流执行的任务要多：
> A parallel execution will always involve more work than a sequential one, because in addition to solving the problem, it also has to perform dispatching and coordinating of sub-tasks.


串行的有优点是它的结果一定是`确定的`，而并行的劣势就是`不确定性`，但有些时候，可以通过对并行执行的方法进行一些`限制`来规避这种`不确定性`，如`规约`方法在并行流中往往需要具备：1
）无状态；2）可组合。
> Further, note that parallelism also often exposes nondeterminism in the computation that is often hidden by sequential implementations; sometimes this doesn't matter, or can be mitigated by constraining the operations involved (i.e., reduction operators must be stateless and associative.)
  

如果并行中涉及`共享资源`，则必须保证线程安全，否则这些`side effect`会扼杀你对并行提速的幻想。
> Moreover, remember that parallel streams don't magically solve all the synchronization problems.
 If a shared resource is used by the predicates and functions used in the process, 
 you'll have to make sure that everything is thread-safe. In particular, side effects are things you really have to worry about if you go parallel.


### 怎么做
`Brian Goetz`给出了一个很不错的角度看这个问题：
> It is best to develop first using sequential execution and then apply parallelism where
> 
> (A) you know that there's actually benefit to increased performance and
> 
> (B) that it will actually deliver increased performance. 
>
> (A) is a business problem, not a technical one. 
> If you are a performance expert, you'll usually be able to look at the code and determine (B), 
> but the smart path is to measure. (And, don't even bother until you're convinced of (A); if the 
code is fast enough, better to apply your brain cycles elsewhere.)

`JB Nizet`也给出了一个比较好的实践方案：
>  I would use sequential streams by default and only consider parallel ones if
>  
>  - I have a massive amount of items to process (or the processing of each item takes time and is 
parallelizable)
>  
>  - I have a performance problem in the first place
>  
>  - I don't already run the process in a multi-thread environment (for example: in a web 
container, if I already have many requests to process in parallel, adding an additional layer of parallelism inside each request could have more negative than positive effects)

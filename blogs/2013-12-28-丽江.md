<p>
On December 28, 2013, I flew from Beijing to Lijiang, a place I had once wanted to visit but missed due to various reasons.
<p>
Speaking of Lijiang, I didn't have any particularly strong feelings about it before. I just knew it was a sort of paradise, a place without the crowds and noise of big cities, without traffic jams or smog, where people lived their small lives leisurely, as if only in Lijiang could one find spiritual purification. But I had also heard voices saying that it was heavily commercialized. With these two conflicting impressions, I arrived at this legendary resort.
<p>
To be honest, it's not so much that I loved Lijiang as that I met this place with longing and yearning. Looking down at Yunnan's land from the plane, at the snow-capped mountains and terraced fields, I fell in love with this place even before landing—the "South of the Colorful Clouds." Yunnan has many stories and people to talk about for me; two friends from my school days were from Kunming. But I came to Yunnan, to Lijiang, alone, without telling anyone, like a sudden intruder breaking into someone else's dream, wandering around, looking here and there, free and filled with secret joy.
<p>
Back to Lijiang, it was the first ancient town I had ever visited. My first impression was of Yunnan's ethnic minorities—their skin was dark. Because it's a plateau with a low latitude, the sunlight is intense, so over the years, everyone's skin has become dark. In terms of facial features, they are quite different from the Han people, with unique facial shapes and features characteristic of ethnic minorities. I was curious and really liked the people here. Most of them were simple and honest, with much more peace and serenity on their faces, especially compared to the tourists from big cities. I remember seeing a middle-aged man pushing a bicycle in Dayan Ancient Town; his simple face and pure eyes are still vivid in my memory, as if such a face could only appear in post-liberation movies, completely out of place in this secular and materialistic world.
<p>
Right now, I'm playing songs by Xiaoqian from Lijiang. In Lijiang Ancient Town, there are shops selling African drums and her CDs everywhere—you can't help but know such a person, as if she were the business card of the ancient town. The first time I heard "A Moment," the lively rhythm of the music combined with the beat of the drums was really pleasant. I unknowingly fell in love with this song and bought the CD. I had originally planned to buy an African drum, but it was too big to carry, so I had to give up.
<p>
It's true that Lijiang Ancient Town is highly commercialized, but that doesn't affect my love for the place at all. I think you can't just focus on its commercial side, feel sad and disappointed as if you've been cheated out of the paradise in your heart. More importantly, you need to learn to perceive its charm. You might only feel the existence of beauty if you truly appreciate it. After all, how would the tourists survive without commerce? It's said that tens of millions of tourists pour into Lijiang Airport every year—without commercialization, that would be impossible.
<p>
Those days were calm and serene, with even no clouds, just a pale blue sky. For someone who had lived in Beijing for many years, the joy in my heart was beyond imagination. I loved going to Lion Mountain to overlook the entire ancient town and even see Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in the distance. This mountain is interesting; it's just there, and you can always catch a glimpse of it inadvertently, luring your curiosity in this way. During my stay in Lijiang, I spent several afternoons entirely at a place called Taohua Island on Lion Mountain. After lunch, drinking water and reading on my Kindle, with the full view of the ancient town to my right and the mountains straight ahead, the sun was strong, but it didn't stop me from idly leaning on the sofa, reading, and enjoying the moment. There weren't many people, and it was so quiet that I could forget the passage of time, listening to the soft music—it was extremely pleasant.
<p>
I remember wandering casually in the ancient town those days, seeing all kinds of tourists, all kinds of beautiful women, and all kinds of dogs. When I was hungry, I ate; I walked around freely, and when I was tired, I sat by the roadside. I watched the Naxi grandmothers dancing in Sifang Street, heard the singing from the bars around, saw people leading horses, and tourists taking photos with eagles. There were also the flower cakes from Jiahua...
<p>
In the evenings after dinner, I would sit by the charcoal fire in Brother Peng's living room, chatting with a group of people—it was fun and warm. I remember that when I first stayed there, there was a girl a few years younger than me and a guy around my age. We chatted about all sorts of things: where we had been, whether it was fun, how to get around, and how to avoid being cheated. The guy left first, and we watched him pull his luggage away. For tourists, this inn was just a stopover. People came back from different places to rest, and maybe the next day they would go somewhere else, only to return in three or four days. It was a cycle, with groups of people coming and going. The girl left in the afternoon, and I was out wandering at the time, so I didn't get to say goodbye.
<p>
After staying at Brother Peng's for a while, I got to know the nearby shop owners. We would all gather there to chat in the evenings. Sometimes I thought that these people and I didn't have deep connections—we were just passers-by who met by chance. But during a journey, you often put such thoughts aside, taking the initiative to get close and chat with others. It's like a microcosm of human beings' need to group together; after all, when you're away from home, everyone needs care and someone to talk to.
<p>
Speaking of the ancient town, I wandered around it for many days, and sometimes I still got lost. So I just stuck to a few important roads I often took. I didn't like using mobile phone navigation tools—it would take away so much fun. I didn't even bring a charger for my phone, let alone a razor. After nine days, my beard grew so long that I was almost embarrassed to say I wasn't an uncle.
<p>
There's a public toilet on Lion Mountain, not very modern. It's the kind with a big ditch in the middle, where water flushes from one end. The dormitories in my school used to have these, maybe to save water? Anyway, I hadn't used such a toilet in years. One lazy afternoon, I tried it again, and hearing the school bell ring for the end of class not far away, it felt like I was suddenly transported back to some sunny childhood days.
<p>
There are many girls in the ancient town taking photo albums, wearing distinctive ethnic costumes, which are really eye-catching. In Lijiang, you can be as beautiful as you want.
<p>
Whether you like Lijiang or not depends on the person. If, like me, you look at everything here with curious eyes and feel everything here with a relaxed mood, you will surely like it too.

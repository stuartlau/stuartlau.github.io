On December 28, 2013, I flew from Beijing to Lijiang, a place I had long wanted to visit but missed due to various reasons.

Speaking of Lijiang, I didn't have any particularly strong feelings about it before. I just knew it was a sort of paradise, free from the crowds and noise of big cities, without traffic jams or smog. People there lived their small lives leisurely, as if only in Lijiang could one find spiritual purification. However, I had also heard that it was heavily commercialized. With these two conflicting impressions, I arrived at this legendary resort.

To be honest, it's not so much that I loved Lijiang as that I encountered this place with longing and yearning. Looking down at Yunnan's land from the plane—at the snow-capped mountains and terraced fields—I fell in love with this place even before landing, this "South of the Colorful Clouds." Yunnan holds many stories and people for me; two friends from my school days were from Kunming. But I came to Yunnan, to Lijiang, alone, without telling anyone. It felt like being a sudden intruder breaking into someone else's dream, wandering around, looking here and there, free and filled with secret joy.

Back to Lijiang—it was the first ancient town I had ever visited. My first impression was of Yunnan's ethnic minorities: their skin was dark. Due to the high altitude and low latitude, the sunlight is intense, so over time, people's skin has become dark. In terms of facial features, they are quite different from the Han people, with unique shapes and features characteristic of ethnic minorities. I was curious and really liked the people here. Most of them were simple and honest, with much more peace and serenity on their faces, especially compared to tourists from big cities. I remember seeing a middle-aged man pushing a bicycle in Dayan Ancient Town; his simple face and pure eyes remain vivid in my memory, as if such a face could only appear in post-liberation movies, completely out of place in this secular and materialistic world.

Right now, I'm playing songs by Xiaoqian from Lijiang. In Lijiang Ancient Town, there are shops selling African drums and her CDs everywhere—you can't help but know her, as if she were the town's business card. The first time I heard *A Moment*, the lively rhythm combined with the drumbeats was really pleasant. I unknowingly fell in love with the song and bought the CD. I had planned to buy an African drum too, but it was too big to carry, so I gave up.

It's true that Lijiang Ancient Town is highly commercialized, but that doesn't affect my love for it at all. I think you can't just focus on its commercial side, feeling sad and disappointed as if you've been cheated out of the paradise in your heart. More importantly, you need to learn to perceive its charm. You might only feel its beauty if you truly appreciate it. After all, how would tourists survive without commerce? It's said that tens of millions of tourists pour into Lijiang Airport every year—without commercialization, that would be impossible.

Those days were calm, with a pale blue sky and even no clouds. For someone who had lived in Beijing for years, the joy in my heart was beyond words. I loved going to Lion Mountain to overlook the entire ancient town and even see Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in the distance. This mountain is interesting: it's just there, and you catch glimpses of it inadvertently, luring your curiosity. During my stay, I spent several afternoons at a place called Taohua Island on Lion Mountain. After lunch, I'd drink water, read on my Kindle, with the ancient town to my right and mountains ahead. The sun was strong, but it didn't stop me from idly leaning on the sofa, reading, and enjoying the moment. There weren't many people, and it was so quiet that I forgot the time, listening to soft music—it was extremely pleasant.

I remember wandering casually in the ancient town, seeing all kinds of tourists, beautiful women, and dogs. When hungry, I ate; I walked around freely, and when tired, I sat by the roadside. I watched Naxi grandmothers dance in Sifang Street, heard singing from surrounding bars, saw people leading horses, tourists taking photos with eagles, and Jiahua's flower cakes...

In the evenings after dinner, I'd sit by the charcoal fire in Brother Peng's living room, chatting with a group of people—it was fun and warm. I remember when I first stayed there, there was a girl a few years younger than me and a guy around my age. We chatted about all sorts of things: where we'd been, if it was fun, how to get around, and how to avoid being cheated. The guy left first, and we watched him pull his luggage away. For tourists, this inn was just a stopover. People returned from different places to rest, then maybe left again the next day, only to return in a few days. It was a cycle, with groups coming and going. The girl left in the afternoon, but I was out wandering and didn't get to say goodbye.

After staying at Brother Peng's for a while, I got to know the nearby shop owners. We'd gather there to chat in the evenings. Sometimes I thought: these people and I had no deep connections—we were just passers-by. But on a journey, you often put such thoughts aside, taking the initiative to get close and chat. It's like a microcosm of human grouping; after all, when away from home, people need care and someone to talk to.

I wandered in the ancient town for days, and sometimes I still got lost. So I stuck to a few familiar main roads. I didn't like using mobile phone navigation—it would take away the fun. I didn't even bring a phone charger, let alone a razor. After nine days, my beard grew so long that I almost felt embarrassed to say I wasn't an uncle.

There's a public toilet on Lion Mountain, not very modern—with a big ditch in the middle and water flushing from one end. My school dormitory had similar ones, maybe to save water? Anyway, I hadn't used such a toilet in years. One lazy afternoon, I tried it again, and hearing the school bell ring for the end of class nearby, it felt like I was suddenly transported back to some sunny childhood days.

Many girls in the ancient town were taking photos in distinctive ethnic costumes, which was really eye-catching. In Lijiang, you can be as beautiful as you want.

Whether you like Lijiang depends on the person. If, like me, you look at everything here with curious eyes and feel everything with a relaxed mood, you'll surely like it too.

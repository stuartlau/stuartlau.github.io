These are two girls from Hong Kong. I met them when we hired a car to go to Lashi Lake.

When they got in the car, I jokingly said, "You're going to Shangri-La too?" and they both froze for a second.

Later, I found out they were from Hong Kong. Since I'd been teaching myself Cantonese, it was the perfect chance to ask them for tips.

The more we talked, the more I realized that the biggest barrier between people is often the one we set for ourselves, not geography or city boundaries. My previous impressions of Hong Kong people were a mix of good and bad, but those were formed in Hong Kong itself. The environment there made me rush to conclusions, just to get a quicker grasp of the city. But here, on the mainland, away from that context, I finally had the time and energy to truly understand what Hong Kong people are like.

Both of them were very friendly and smiled a lot. Their Mandarin wasn't great, but they tried hard to speak it. They still talked to each other in Cantonese, but I could understand some of it, so it never felt awkward. As we opened up more, the funniest thing was that eventually, they'd speak to me in Mandarin while I replied in Cantonese.

We went to Lashi Lake together, rode horses, rowed boats, and visited Shuhe Ancient Town and Baisha Ancient Town. Qiao was with us too. We took lots of photos. Qiao even lost his phone by accident, but luckily it was in the hired car. The driver was kind enough to take it straight back to our inn. On the way back, we took a local bus but had no idea how to transfer back to the ancient town. We ended up asking for directions to make the transfer—it was quite an adventure.

I remember Min'er told me on the way back that relationships between people in Hong Kong aren't as close as they are here. She said if people live in the same building, they might not even know who their neighbors are, unless they live in low-rise houses where neighbors might get to know each other. That made me think of Beijing now. I secretly wondered if she was sharing this because she felt comfortable with us after a day of hanging out, enjoying how open and sincere we all were.

Min'er works in Hong Kong, and Jane is from Australia. Jane was an exchange student at Tsinghua University for a year. They once visited Beijing together in winter—apparently, it was snowing, and they were the only ones on the Great Wall that day.

I had to take a train to Kunming that night, so we had a meal of braised chicken together. I forgot to tell the boss not to put chili, though—Hong Kong people can't handle spicy food, and neither can I. The whole chicken was probably too big for four people. Jane asked if we were being wasteful, and I felt a twinge of guilt. It's just that meeting up like this is so rare, and we were about to part ways. Indulging a little felt okay, and frugality and rationality took a backseat to impulse. I wondered if I should feel bad about that.

I always value these temporary friendships formed during travels. At least I do. When people share similar interests and get along well, choosing to walk the journey together is such a precious 缘分 —simple and sincere, which makes it all the more valuable.

After the meal, I rushed back to pack my things, not wanting to keep my friend from Foshan waiting. I left directly by car without getting to say goodbye, but as the car passed the restaurant, I saw the three of them chatting and smiling. For me, catching that warm scene from the side felt like a perfect ending. Still, I couldn't help worrying, so I called them to say goodbye properly. If we get the chance, we'll meet again—in Beijing, Hong Kong, or Australia.

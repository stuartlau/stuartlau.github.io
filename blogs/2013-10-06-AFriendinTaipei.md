I’m being serious. This really is a friend of mine.

He’s Taiwanese, a few years younger than me, taller than me, and better-looking too. We first met online.

I originally just wanted to find a local Taiwanese person to welcome me, chat a bit, have a meal or drinks together. Little did I know, he took it seriously.

He walked every street in Taipei with me—Taipei Palace Museum, Tamsui, Yongkang Street. We cycled around Hai 迪 Park together. When we hit a slope while cycling, he said, “This is where a man is tested. Never take the downhill path in life.” After hearing that, I pushed myself to the limit and pedaled up.

He took me around Taipei by bus, took me up Elephant Mountain to see Taipei 101 and the city’s night view—we were both soaked in sweat by the time we reached the top.

He’d carefully take photos of me and tell me not to always wear a grumpy face.

He brought pineapple cakes from his home, which was dozens of kilometers away, just because I said I’d never tried them and didn’t know what they were.

At 11 PM, he rode his scooter to the youth hostel to find me, insistent on taking me to the 24-hour Eslite Bookstore.

We rode through Zhongxiao East Road, and I asked him why people “walk it nine times.” He said he didn’t know either.

After 2 AM, we ate late-night snacks at a street stall, and the place was packed.

The day before I flew back to Hong Kong, I took a train to Zhongli City, where his home is. He was already waiting outside the station on his scooter. As soon as I walked out, he rushed over to greet me—I didn’t even see him at first.

He bought tickets for a Taipei professional baseball game, insistent that I experience it, just because I said I liked baseball but that there wasn’t much of it in mainland China.

He brought two of his good friends to hang out with me—we watched MTV together, had late-night snacks, and sat outside the school library chatting and joking around.

I met his mom and sister, and they were both very kind.

He took me all over the streets looking for a stationery store, determined to help me find the right postcard, just because I said I wanted to send one back home.

He let me sleep in his room while he slept on the couch.

He woke up at 5 AM, rode his scooter to take me to Taoyuan Airport, zooming all the way. The sunrise that day was beautiful.

When he saw me off at the security checkpoint, he looked like he was about to cry. I even wondered if he’d fallen for me.

Truth is, I can’t stand goodbyes. But when another guy is struggling more than me, I decided to be strong.

Chinlin—this is my good friend.
